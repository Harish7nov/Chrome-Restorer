# Chrome-Restorer
A simple Python project to save and restore the opened websites in all the tabs of any browser.

I generally work with a lot of chrome tabs containing tons of information for me to study later.

Most of the web browsers out there do provide an option to restore the window that was closed previously, but once I unknowingly closed the second Chrome window finally and lost all the tabs on the first window because I was not able to restore the first window since the second window was closed finally.

In order to overcome this problem I ended up creating this project.

# How to use it?

First of all note the position of the mouse cursor to be pointed on the address bar of the browser that you wish to use.
To do so, dollow the instructions in saver.py

Once all the links are saved, then you can direcly run restore.py to restore all the saved links.

Remember to go to the browser page within 5 seconds for the both the scripts to work.

## Packages Required for the code to work
1. pyautogui
2. pyperclip
