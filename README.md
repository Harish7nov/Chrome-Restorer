# Chrome-Restorer
A simple Python project to save and restore the opened websites in all the tabs of any browser.

I generally work with a lot of chrome tabs containing tons of information for me to study later.
Most of the web browsers out there do provide an option to restore all the tabs that were closed previously, but I have suffered when I closed a second chrome page and lost all the tabs on the main page.

In order to overcome this problem I created a simple python project to save and restore all the tabs.
